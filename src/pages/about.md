### So, about the "name"

So, I'm not an egomaniac... in fact, I'm probably the opposite. So, for the record, I didn't give myself the title of 'Trek Stud.' I mean, I'm not some trail 'F-boy' ðŸ¤·. In fact, I named my company Trek Studio because I'm a landscape photographer, hence 'trek' + 'studio.' So when I purchased the domain trekstud.io, I thought I was being slick; however, most people never read past the period. So, my friends joked and renamed me 'Trek Stud'â€”they wanted to embarrass me. So, I did what any self-conscious (not really true) individual would do... and made that my trail name. It's my world, and I do what I want. Don't judge me.

## How it happened

I've been a website and graphic designer, either in perfession or as a hobby, since AOL and probably before. Photography was kind of just an accident; however, I've become addicted and now see photos everywhere I look. So creating a photography business and a brand was just a matter of time. Eventually, all my hobbies became an income, and that's living the dream.

## The Mission

I only want to share the information that I learn day after day, and hopefully, I can help someone else with the knowledge that I always needed, but nobody else wanted to share. At the end of the day, I just want to follow the 'golden rule'â€”the principle of treating others as one wants to be treated.
Just facts ðŸ’¯
