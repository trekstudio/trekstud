### <a name="#rain"></a> Rain gear

Rain jackets and rain pants are indispensable gear when hiking due to diverse and unpredictable weather conditions. These waterproof layers act as a shield against the frequent rain showers, snowfall at higher elevations, and chilly winds that hikers can encounter along the trail. Beyond keeping you dry, rain gear also serves as a critical component of your overall warmth and comfort strategy, preventing hypothermia and allowing you to maintain a consistent pace, even in less-than-ideal weather. So, whether you're seeking shelter from a sudden downpour in the desert or braving the wettest sections in the Cascades, a quality rain jacket and rain pants are essential for staying dry, warm, and safe on your journey.
